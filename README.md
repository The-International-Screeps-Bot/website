# The Internationals Website
The present work concerns the upcoming website for the communism-themed Screeps Bot movement, hosted using the GitHub pages functionality. This open-source project invites contributions from interested individuals, who may clone or fork the repository and submit pull requests.

For those wishing to set up the website locally, the following steps are recommended:

First, open the "website" folder in a preferred code editor such as Visual Studio Code.

Next, execute the "npm install" command within the "website" directory.

To facilitate the visualization of changes in real-time, the author recommends enabling auto-save within the editor by navigating to the File menu and selecting "automatically save". To run the development server, one may type "npm run dev" within the terminal.
